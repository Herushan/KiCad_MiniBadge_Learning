# KiCad_MiniBadge_Learning
The files used for the KiCad MiniBadge Learning YouTube series. 
YouTube to first video [Episode One or Step One of making your own minibadge](https://youtu.be/156MaRJBwHk?si=-d4g35n8yYzdG-6n).
Currently files up to video 2.

Using KiCad 8 I go through the steps of making a minibadge and some of the settings and atributes to go with it. This is the KiCad documents and files for the project that I created and run through in the videos.
